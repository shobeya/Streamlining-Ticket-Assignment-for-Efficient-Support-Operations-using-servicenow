Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations Using ServiceNow
Abstract

In modern IT service management, manual ticket routing causes delays, human errors, and uneven workload distribution. This project automates ticket assignment using ServiceNow Flow Designer, dynamically routing issues to relevant teams such as Platform or Certificates.
By leveraging Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), the system ensures secure, efficient, and transparent ticket management — improving response time, accountability, and customer satisfaction.

Project Objective

The goal is to automate ticket routing in ServiceNow, ensuring each issue reaches the right team promptly and accurately.

Key objectives:

Eliminate manual routing delays

Reduce human error

Improve resolution speed and transparency

Implement secure, role-based access

Enhance customer satisfaction through workflow automation

Existing System

In the manual system, coordinators assign tickets by evaluating each issue — leading to:

Human error and inconsistent prioritization

Longer response times

Difficulty in workload tracking

Poor visibility and accountability

Proposed System

The automated system uses ServiceNow Flow Designer to dynamically route tickets:

Assigns tickets to groups (e.g., Platform or Certificates) based on issue type

Ensures real-time notifications and automatic updates

Applies ACL and RBAC for data security

Enhances scalability and performance visibility

System Analysis

Identified needs:

Centralized ticket management

Automatic issue-based routing

Role-based access control

Real-time tracking and scalability

System Design

The system integrates modules for:

User Management

Group Management

Role Management

Access Control

Flow Automation

Design highlights:

Modular architecture

RBAC for controlled access

ServiceNow tables for structured data (Issue, Description, Assigned Group, Status)

Modules

User Management – Handles user creation and role assignment

Group Management – Defines logical groups for issue categories

Role Management – Implements permission levels

Table Management – Stores ticket data

Flow Designer – Automates ticket routing

Access Control – Ensures security and data transparency

Methodology

Step-by-step ServiceNow configuration:

Create Users – Add authorized accounts

Create Groups – Certificates and Platform

Create Roles – Define access privileges

Create Table – “Operations Related” with fields for issue tracking

Assign Roles and Users to Groups

Assign Roles to Table

Create ACL (Access Control Lists)

Build Flows in Flow Designer to automate routing based on issue type

Technical Architecture

Platform: ServiceNow

Modules: Users, Groups, Roles, Tables, ACLs

Security: RBAC + ACLs

Core Engine: Flow Designer

The architecture ensures seamless ticket flow, logging, and audit control. It enforces data integrity and transparency while maintaining scalability and performance.

Results

85% reduction in assignment time

Balanced workload distribution

Automated routing accuracy

Enhanced SLA compliance and team performance

Advantages

Automated ticket routing

Enhanced accuracy and transparency

Role-based security

Scalable and auditable system

Reduced operational costs

Disadvantages

Requires technical setup expertise

ServiceNow licensing cost

Cloud dependency

Staff training required for administration

Future Enhancements

Integrate AI/NLP-based ticket classification

Add chatbot and SLA monitoring

Implement Power BI dashboards

Enable multi-channel input (email/voice)

Extend to mobile app support

Integrate predictive analytics for workload forecasting
